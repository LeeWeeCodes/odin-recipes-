 <h2>Ingredients</h2>  
   <body>
    <ul>
        <li>Salmon- This ingredient is really the star of the show, so choose a good quality smoked salmon. I used wild Alaskan sockeye salmon that was applewood smoked.</li>
        <li>Cream cheese- Plain, full-fat cream cheese is used for this smoked salmon bagel. You can also use flavored ones, such as scallion or chive, for added flavor.</li>
        <li>Bagel- Plain bagels are great because they offer a hard outer layer and a fluffy inside, and the flavor is mild enough to not overshadow the smoked salmon. </li>
    </ul>
   </body>
<h2>Steps</h2>
  <body>
    <ul>
        <li>Toast the bagel. Toast the sliced plain bagels in a toaster until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the cream cheese. Then spread your desired amount of cream cheese on top of each halved bagel.</li>
        <li>Assemble rest of bagel toppings. Now add the smoked salmon and the rest of your favorite salmon bagel toppings. Serve.
        </li>
